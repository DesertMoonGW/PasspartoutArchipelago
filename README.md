# PasspartoutArchipelago
*Even you can become a great artist! Wrestle subjectivity as you attempt to sell your art to rude customers in order to progress in this confusing art scene. The only thing threatening you is your expensive wine and baguette addiction! Will your art end up in the Louvre or on your parents' fridge?*

Sell paintings to gain Archipelago Points (APP), and once you gain enough APP, send a Location! In Act I a Location is 100 APP, in Act II it's 300 APP, and in Act III it's 900 APP, there's 10 Painting Sale Locations per Act. You also send a Location when you manage to pay the bills, 5 per Act.

Receive Checks of Money, Tools, and Fame to keep you afloat and reach an ending. The amount of money you get equals the Location of that Act, 100 APP in Act I, 300 APP in Act II, and 900 APP in Act III. There's a Check for the Caligraphy Pen, the Spray Can, 8 Progressive Fame, and all remaining Checks are Money.
